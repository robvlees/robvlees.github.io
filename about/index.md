# Rob Vleeshouwers

## Linux System Engineer & Blender Artist

## Personal Introduction

Hello! I'm Rob Vleeshouwers, a passionate Linux System Engineer with over three decades of experience in IT infrastructure and system administration. My journey began in the early 1990s as a technical support assistant, working with diverse computing platforms including IBM AS/400, Unix systems, and Windows environments. What started as a technical career has evolved into a blend of professional expertise and creative expression through 3D art and design using Blender.

## Professional Journey

My career has been marked by continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies. I've had the privilege of working across various industries, from financial services to manufacturing, always focusing on creating robust, scalable, and secure IT infrastructures. My experience spans multiple operating systems including AIX, RHEL, SUSE, and Ubuntu, with a strong foundation in cloud technologies, containerization, and infrastructure automation. I've successfully led teams in implementing DevOps practices, managing complex system integrations, and developing automated solutions that improve efficiency and reduce operational overhead.

## Creative Exploration

Beyond my technical work, I'm deeply passionate about 3D artistry using Blender. This creative outlet complements my analytical approach to problem-solving and provides a unique way to express ideas visually. My Blender gallery showcases landscapes, environments, characters, and complex animation sequences that demonstrate both my artistic development and technical skills in the 3D pipeline. The process of creating 3D models, textures, animations, and renders has taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of iterative improvement - skills that directly translate back to my professional work.

## Personal Interests & Values

When I'm not working with systems or creating 3D art, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or sharing knowledge with the community. I believe in the power of continuous learning and the importance of helping others grow in their technical journeys. My multicultural background and multilingual abilities have enabled me to work effectively in international environments, bridging cultural and technical gaps.
