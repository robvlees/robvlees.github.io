Hello, I’m a Linux DevOPS Engineer with a wide knowledge of IT infrastructures, security, application services and how to integrate different computing platforms with each other. Has overall responsibility for the “blueprint” or technology architecture that drives the other services. Good communication skills preferable in the language the customer demands is necessary to understand the customer needs and implement their requirements in a practical way rather than theoretical.

I'm a strong supported of the Open Source Cummunity and in my Blog I will mainly write Articles who are Technical and Open Source oriented.

Open source should be:

**Accessible Source Code:** The core defining feature is the public availability of the software's source code, unlike proprietary or "closed-source" software where the code is kept secret.   
**Freedom to Use and Modify:** Users have the right to run the software for any purpose and to change and adapt it to their requirements.  
**Community-Driven Development:** Open source projects often thrive on a global community of developers and users who collaborate to improve, fix bugs, and add new features to the software.  
**Redistribution:** The modified or unmodified software can be freely shared with others, often without cost.  

In my free time I like to be more creative and use <a href="https://blender.org" target="_blank">Blender 3D</a> software. It covers the entire 3D pipeline, including modeling, sculpting, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, and video editing. Blender is a powerful, versatile tool used by both professional artists and enthusiasts due to its wide range of features and active development community. One section will be completely dedicated to the rendered images I created with it.
