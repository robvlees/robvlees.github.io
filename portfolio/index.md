## Technical Expertise

As a Linux DevOPS Engineer, I specialize in designing and implementing robust IT infrastructures with a focus on security and integration. My work spans across:

- **Infrastructure Design**: Creating scalable architectures that support enterprise-level applications
- **Security Implementation**: Developing secure computing platforms with proper access controls
- **Integration Solutions**: Connecting diverse computing platforms through effective APIs and middleware
- **Open Source Advocacy**: Promoting accessible, community-driven software solutions

## Blender 3D Artistry

In my creative time, I explore the full 3D pipeline using Blender, including:
- Modeling and sculpting
- Animation and simulation
- Rendering and compositing
- Motion tracking and video editing

My portfolio showcases both technical projects and artistic creations that demonstrate my skills in both areas.

## Featured Projects

### Technical Projects
- Infrastructure automation scripts
- Security configuration frameworks
- Cross-platform integration solutions

### Artistic Creations
- Landscape and environment renders
- Character and object modeling
- Complex animation sequences
